Playground
This tool is used to visualize and test your agents and automations created using the "Agents & Automations" app type.
Unsupported state: your index is currently locked. This can happen if multiple git processes are running operations at the same time.
Please resolve the issue by ending those git operations. If you are sure you do not have git operations running, you can delete your .git/index.lock file.
